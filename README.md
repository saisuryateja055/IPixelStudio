# IPixelStudio
This project is a text-to-image application that leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to convert textual descriptions into images. It combines the simplicity of Streamlit for the frontend with the power of LangChain and Eden.ai to handle image generation, and uses PIL (Pillow) for image handling and manipulation.

## Features

- **Streamlit Interface**: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit that allows users to easily input text and receive images.
- **LangChain Integration**: Utilizes LangChain for seamless integration of AI language models in the image generation process.
- **Eden.ai Image Generation**: Leverages Eden.ai's capabilities for generating high-quality images from text descriptions.
- **PIL for Image Handling**: Uses Python Imaging Library (PIL) to manipulate and manage images effectively.
